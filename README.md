# This is just a test repository to grease my groove in GitHub

It's been a long while since I've used GitHub. The last time I've used GitHub was during our thesis period at my university. The time where I learned how to develop programs for Raspberry Pi as well as tinkering and experimenting with TensorFlow Lite.
